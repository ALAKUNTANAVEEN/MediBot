# MediBot
In this project, we create a chatbot using scikit-learn that helps users with their symptoms. The chatbot asks users about their symptoms and provides details and advice. We collect a dataset with symptoms, conditions, and advice. After preprocessing the data, we convert symptoms into numerical features. Using scikit-learn's algorithms, we train a model on the dataset. Users interact with the chatbot, inputting their symptoms. The model predicts the condition and retrieves relevant details and advice. We continuously gather feedback and improve the chatbot. Accuracy is ensured by consulting medical professionals and trusted sources. The chatbot serves as a helpful tool for users seeking information and guidance regarding their symptoms.
